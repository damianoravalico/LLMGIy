We first calculate the bounciness index by dividing the height of the first bounce by the starting height.\n2. Then, we calculate the total distance traveled by iterating over the number of bounces. For each bounce, we calculate the height of the ball after the bounce using the bounciness index, and then calculate the distance traveled in that bounce using the formula `2 * starting_height * (1 - bounciness_index ** (i + 1))`. This formula assumes that the ball travels up and down with a constant acceleration, and that the bounce is perfectly elastic.\n3. We add the distance traveled in each bounce to the total distance, and update the starting height for the next bounce.\n4. Finally, we return the bounciness index and the total distance traveled.\n\nYou can test this function with sample inputs, such as:\n```\nstarting_height = 10\nfirst_bounce_height = 5\nnum_bounces = 3\nbounciness_index, total_distance = calculate_bounciness_and_distance(starting_height, first_bounce_height, num_bounces)\nprint(bounciness_index, total_distance)\n```\nThis should output the bounciness index and the total distance traveled by the ball.",

We import the `math` module, but we don't actually use it in this function. I included it just in case you wanted to use some mathematical functions later on.\n2. The function takes three arguments: `starting_height`, `first_bounce_height`, and `num_bounces`.\n3. We calculate the bounciness index by dividing the height of the first bounce by the starting height.\n4. We then calculate the total distance traveled by iterating `num_bounces` times.

It first calculates the bounciness index using the `calculate_bounciness_index` function. Then, it uses a loop to calculate the distance traveled by the ball in each bounce. The distance in each bounce is calculated as the starting height multiplied by 2 raised to the power of the bounce number (i.e., `starting_height * math.pow(2, i)`), and then multiplied by the bounciness index. The total distance is the sum of the distances in each bounce.\n\nYou can use these functions like this:\n```\nstarting_height = 10\nfirst_bounce_height = 8\nnum_bounces = 5\n\nbounciness_index = calculate_bounciness_index(starting_height, first_bounce_height)\nprint(bounciness_index)  # Output: 0.8\n\ntotal_distance = calculate_total_distance(starting_height, first_bounce_height, num_bounces)\nprint(total_distance)  # Output: 40.0\n```\nNote that this assumes a simple model of bouncing, where the ball's height in each bounce is proportional to the height in the previous bounce, and the bounciness index is constant. In reality, the ball's motion may be more complex, and this model may not accurately predict the ball's behavior.",

The total distance is the sum of the distances in each bounce.\n\nYou can use these functions like this:\n```\nstarting_height = 10\nfirst_bounce_height = 8\nnum_bounces = 5\n\nbounciness_index = calculate_bounciness_index(starting_height, first_bounce_height)\nprint(bounciness_index)  # Output: 0.8\n\ntotal_distance = calculate_total_distance(starting_height, first_bounce_height, num_bounces)\nprint(total_distance)  # Output: 40.0\n```\nNote that this assumes a simple model of bouncing, where the ball's height in each bounce is proportional to the height in the previous bounce, and the bounciness index is constant.

For each bounce, we calculate the height of the ball after the bounce using the bounciness index and the current starting height.\n3. We calculate the distance traveled in this bounce using the formula `2 * sqrt(2 * starting_height * (1 - bounciness_index))`, which is derived from the physics of a ball bouncing.\n4. We add the distance to the total distance and update the starting height for the next bounce.\n5. Finally, we return the total distance traveled.\n\nYou can test this function with different inputs to see how it works!",
