Problem Name;Description
Basement;Given a list of integers, what is the position of the first integer such that the sum of all integers from the start to it inclusive is negative?
Bouncing Balls;"Given a starting height and a height after first bounce of a dropped ball, calculate the ""bounciness index"" (height of first bounce / starting height). Then, given a number of bounces, use the bounciness index to calculate how far the ball travels"
Bowling;Given a string representing the individual bowls in a 10-frame round of 10 pin bowling, return the score of that round as an integer
Coin Sums;Given a random currency (random numbers [1, 50] of length [1, 10]), how many different ways can you make n pounds?
Camel Case;"Take a string and convert all of the words to camelCase. Each group of words is delimitered by ""-"", and each group of words is separated by a space"
Cut Vector;Given an array, find the spot where if you cut the array, the numbers on both sides are either equal, or the difference is as small as possible
Dice Game;Peter has an n sided die and Colin has an m sided die. If they both roll their dice, what is the probabilitiy that Peter rolls strictly higher than Colin
Find Pair;Given a list of integers, find the two that sum to a target integer. Return those two integers.
Fizz Buzz;"Given an integer 1 <= x <= 50,000, return ""Fizz"" if x is divisible by 3, ""Buzz"" if x is divisible by 5, ""FizzBuzz"" if x is divisible by 3 and 5, and x if none of the above hold."
Fuel Cost;Given a list of integers, divide each by 3, round down, and subtract 2. Then sum the result.
GCD;Given two numbers, return the GCD 
Indices of Substring;Given a text string and a target string, return a list of integers of the indices at which the target appears in the text. Targets may overlap.
Leaders;Given an array of positive integers, find the leaders in the array. A leader is defined as a number that is greater than or equal to all the numbers to the right of it. The rightmost element is always a leader.
Luhn;Implement the Luhn algorithm to verify a number, such that it follows the following rules: double every other digit starting from the second to last item and going from right to left (another way to think about this is double every other starting with the first element if even, starting with the second element if odd). If any of the numbers are over 9, subtract 9 from them. Then, sum all of the remaining digits together. Divide that number by 10, and if it equals 0, then it is valid, so return true. Otherwise, return false.
Mastermind;Given a code and a guess, return the number of white pegs (correct color, wrong place) and black pegs (correct color, correct place) the codemaster should give as a clue
Middle Character;"Given a string, if it is odd length return the middle character; if it is even length, return the two middle characters."
Paired Digits;Given a string of digits, sum those digits whose next digit is the same.
Shopping List;Given a list of floats representing the prices of various shopping goods and another list of floats representing the percent discount of each of those goods, calculate the total price of the shopping trip  
Snow Day;Given 1 int (hours) and 3 floats (current snow, falling snow, percent melting), determine how much snow will be on the ground in the amount of hours given
Solve Boolean;Evaluate a boolean expression
Spin Words;Given a string of one or more words (separted by a space), reverse all of the words that are five or more letters long
Square Digits;Given a non-negtive integer, square each digit and concatenate the results into a returned string.
Substitution Cipher;This problem gives 3 strings. The first two represent a cipher, mapping one character in one string to the one in the same position in the other string. The program must apply this cipher to the third string to find the deciphered message.
Twitter;" Twitter famously only allows tweets of up to 140 characters. Write a code fragment that allows the user to type in a tweet. If the tweet has more than 140 characters, return the message ""Too many characters"". If the tweet is empty, return the message ""You didn't type anything"". Otherwise, return ""Your tweet has X characters"", where the X is the number of characters in the message."
Vector Distance;Given two vectors of floats, calculate the Euclidean distance between the two vectors in n-dimensional space
